  <h3>What is CSS ?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
    <li>
        <del>
            CSS is not necessary
        </del> 
        <span class="highlight">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>
         It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        </li>
    <li>
        <em>
            <u>
        External stylesheet are stored in CSS files
    </u>
</em>
</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, 
      <span class="highlight">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
    ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a 
    special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p class="footer">
    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used 
    to target elements to which a style should be applied
